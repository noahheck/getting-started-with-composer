# Getting Started with Composer

### Composer

> Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Composer is an absolute necessity for creating modern PHP applications and websites and it's [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) is excellent.

### Getting Started with Composer

The goal of this work is to generate a one-page resource that contains enough information for PHP developers to begin working effectively with Composer.

The resources are intended to be distributed to:
- Conference attendees being exposed to Composer/PHP
- Students
- Educators
- Corporate employees
- Anyone working with or interested in working with Composer and who would benefit from having a quick reference resource available

### Why One Page

The purpose of the project is to make approaching Composer as easy as possible for new users. If the software can be explained in a single page, users may feel less intimidated by getting started using it.

The content contained in the project resources will have to be targeted to providing answers only to the most common getting started questions.

Targeting a single page will help ensure the scope of the project is kept in check. The Composer executable contains over 30 commands and a project could very well provide detail on how to use all of them. However, that content would not fit in a single page, so this is not the project for that.

### Project

The content of the project exists within the [repository file (getting-started-with-composer.md)](getting-started-with-composer.md). If new contributions are added, the content of the repository file will be entered into [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) Writer to generate the [OpenDocument text document](resources/GettingStartedWithComposer.odt) resource. The LibreOffice Writer *Export as PDF* feature will be used to generate the [PDF Document](resources/GettingStartedWithComposer.pdf) resource.

### Document Specifications

To ensure the resource content contained in one page provides the desired value (including readability and accessibility), a [specification for formatting of the OpenDocument text document resource](resource-formatting-specification.md) has been created. Updates to this work will follow the specification when updating the resources. *Note: like all things in this project, the spec is not considered final and can be adjusted as needed.*
